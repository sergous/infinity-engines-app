![social-preview-dark](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9697a7da-10aa-4661-bb76-b5bc0dd611f0)

## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive starter project for developing React Native and Expo applications with Supabase as the backend. It integrates various technologies such as Expo Router for navigation, Tailwind CSS for styling, React-Hook-Form for form handling, Zod for schema validation, and TypeScript for type safety. By leveraging these powerful tools, this starter template provides a robust foundation for building modern, scalable, and efficient mobile applications.

## Available Commands

The project includes several commands for development, building, and deploying your application:

```bash
# Start the development server
npm start
# or with Bun
bun start

# Start the development server for web
npm run web
# or with Bun
bun start --web

# Build the web application for production
npm run build

# Run the application on Android
npm run android

# Run the application on iOS
npm run ios

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Generate color constants
npm run generate-colors

# Run the post-build script manually (for PWA support)
npm run post-build
```

## PWA Support

This project includes full Progressive Web App (PWA) support, allowing your application to be installed on devices and work offline. PWA features include:

- Installable web application with icon on home screen
- Offline support via service worker caching
- Splash screen and themed experience
- Fast loading and performance optimization

### PWA Configuration

PWA settings are configured in the following files:

- `app.json` - Contains basic PWA settings in the `web` section
- `web/manifest.json` - Web App Manifest with application metadata
- `web/service-worker.js` - Service Worker for caching and offline support
- `web/index.html` - Custom HTML template with PWA meta tags

### Building the PWA

To build the application as a PWA, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command builds the web application and automatically applies PWA configurations through the post-build script.

### Testing the PWA

After building, you can test the PWA using a local server:

```bash
npx serve dist/
```

Open the application in Chrome, open Developer Tools (F12), navigate to the Application tab, and check:

1. The Manifest section to verify the PWA manifest
2. The Service Workers section to verify registration
3. Look for the install icon in the address bar
